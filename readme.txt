P2P UI is a WordPress plugin designed to be used in conjuction with Posts 2 Posts, a plugin by scribu.
Posts 2 Posts URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/posts-to-posts/

The basic idea is a post-type of connection, which holds information about posts connections.
These connections are then registered at init.

Additionally, a post-type of data-type is created. This is used in a similar manner to create new post-types.

This is a very simple, somewhat hacky implementation of this idea.

If you'd like to steal the idea and start from scratch, please do so (and let me know).
